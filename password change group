#Description: Script to reset user passwords in group and force a password change at next logon
#
#Written by: Todd Baron
#Script assumes that users have been put into group called "group" within the AD structure shown below. This also assumes the $password variable fulfills requirements for domain password policy
#
#
$reply = Read-Host -Prompt "Are you sure you want to continue?[y/n]"
while ($reply -ne "y"){
  if ($reply -eq "n"){
    exit
}
  $reply = Read-Host "Are you sure you want to continue?[y/n]?"
}

Import-Module ActiveDirectory
#
#Set temporary password
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText "NewPassword1" -Force
#Get users from group and pipe into password change
Get-ADUser -Filter {memberof -RecursiveMatch "CN=group,OU=PasswordChangeGroups,OU=User Groups,OU=Groups,OU=BaseOU,DC=ad,DC=domain,DC=com"} | Set-ADAccountPassword -NewPassword $password -Reset
#Get users from samge group and set password change at next logon
